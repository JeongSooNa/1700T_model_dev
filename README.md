# 1700T Model Development
### For Web after 1700T model validation project
This web was created to effectively use 1700T model data.  
Made for in-house use.  
It is a demo version before database construction, so sufficient correction and feedback are required.  
If necessary, we can request the co-work from the AI center team after completing the demo version.
